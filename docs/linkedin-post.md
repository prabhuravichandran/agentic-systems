🚀 Just shipped v0.1.0 of my MCP Memory Server!

Built a production-grade infrastructure layer that gives AI agents persistent, queryable memory using Anthropic's Model Context Protocol.

🎯 The Problem:
LLMs forget everything between sessions. Re-sending 50k+ tokens costs $1-3 per run and limits agents to single-session tasks.

💡 The Solution:
Local-first semantic memory with ChromaDB that agents can query across sessions.

🛠️ Engineering Highlights:
✅ Full CI/CD with GitHub Actions
✅ Multi-version Python testing (3.10-3.12)  
✅ Architecture Decision Records
✅ >80% test coverage
✅ Type-safe with mypy
